# DotWorld Logic


## Within a World, a Dot continuously:

1. Views the other Dots near him, choosing whether or not to interact.

2. Chooses his next move.

3. Applies the move.

4. Evaluates the result of his move.

    evaluates:
    - others, individually
    - the world as a whole
    - his "self"


## A Dot will stop moving if:

* He perceives he has no moves available.

          -or-

* He does not have sufficient motivation to choose a move.


## Functional Flow

```
  Dot.getNextMove
   |   |
   |   |__ interactWithOthers (manage step contracts)
   |   |
   |   |__ chooseNextStep
   |
   V
  Dot.applyMove
   |
   |
   V
  Dot.evaluate

```

## DotWorld UI

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A world is shared amongst a set of Dots...

   |    |    |    |
  Dot  Dot  Dot  Dot        Each with their own view of its state...

    ========>  Dot  Dot  Dot        Each with their own view of the others
                                            with whom they have interacted.
